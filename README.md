# GeoSN-Ruby
A Geo Social Network experimental work using MongoDB geo-spatial Indexes and queries build with Ruby.

The program is separated into two modules in the appropriate ruby files. The geo module and the social module.
The general framework is making use of primitive mechanices of geo and social module in order to achieve more complex
queries like RangeFriends and NearestFriends.

The implementation is based on and inspired by the following Academic Paper
* A general framework for geo-social query processing (http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2536218)
